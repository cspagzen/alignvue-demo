## 1. DATA MODEL & CORE CONCEPTS

### 1.1 TEAMS
Teams are the fundamental delivery units. Each team has:

**6 Health Dimensions** (4-state system):
- **Capacity**: Team's bandwidth to take on work
  - Healthy (Green): Team has capacity
  - At Risk (Yellow/Orange): Team is stretched
  - Critical (Red): Team is overloaded
  - Not Set (Gray): No data
  
- **Skillset**: Technical capabilities needed
  - Healthy: Has all required skills
  - At Risk: Missing some skills
  - Critical: Severe skill gaps
  
- **Vision**: Clarity of direction and goals
  - Healthy: Clear vision and alignment
  - At Risk: Some confusion
  - Critical: No clear direction
  
- **Support**: Tools, resources, org backing
  - Healthy: Well-supported
  - At Risk: Some support gaps
  - Critical: Severely under-resourced
  
- **Team Cohesion** (Teamwork): Collaboration quality
  - Healthy: Strong collaboration
  - At Risk: Some friction
  - Critical: Serious dysfunction
  
- **Autonomy**: Decision-making independence
  - Healthy: Can self-direct
  - At Risk: Some blocking dependencies
  - Critical: Constantly blocked

**Additional Team Metrics**:
- **Utilization**: Percentage of capacity used (0-100%)
  - Over 95% = Overloaded (critical risk)
  - 70-95% = Healthy range
  - Under 50% = Underutilized
  
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Active Stories**: Number of current work items
- **Flagged/Blocked Stories**: Items with impediments
- **Blockers**: Critical impediments
- **Comments**: Text notes about team status

**Team Health Levels** (Overall):
- **Healthy**: 0 dimensions at-risk or critical
- **Low Risk**: 1-2 dimensions at-risk or critical
- **High Risk**: 3-4 dimensions at-risk or critical  
- **Critical**: 5-6 dimensions at-risk or critical

### 1.2 INITIATIVES
Initiatives are the work efforts that teams execute on.

**Initiative Types**:
- **Strategic** (Blue): Core business value, strategic objectives
- **KTLO** (Yellow): Keep-The-Lights-On, operational maintenance
- **Emergent** (Purple): Unplanned but critical work

**Validation Status** (Critical for risk):
- **Not Validated** (Red dot): Assumptions not tested
- **In Validation** (Teal dot): Currently validating
- **Fully Validated** (Green dot): Customer/problem/solution validated

**Initiative Priority** (Position on board):
- Priorities 1-15: "Above the Mendoza Line" - Active work
- Priorities 16+: "Below the Mendoza Line" - Backlog/Future work
- **Mendoza Line**: Threshold between "can deliver" and "cannot deliver"
  - Usually row 5/6 boundary
  - Named after baseball's incompetence threshold
  - Below this line = we lack capacity to deliver

**Initiative Data Fields**:
- **Name/Title**: Initiative identifier
- **Type**: Strategic/KTLO/Emergent
- **Priority**: Position (1-15 above line, 16+ below)
- **Validation**: not-validated/in-validation/validated
- **Progress**: % complete (0-100)
- **Teams**: Array of team names assigned
- **Stories**: Number of user stories
- **Flagged**: Number of blocked/flagged stories
- **Blockers**: Critical impediments
- **Activity Type**: development, validation, prototyping, infrastructure, etc.

**Initiative Canvas Components**:
When validated, initiatives have a canvas with:
1. Desired Outcome (from OKRs)
2. Success Metrics
3. Opportunity Size
4. Customer (Who wants this?)
5. Problem (What are we solving?)
6. Solution (How we solve it)
7. Big Picture (Strategic context)
8. Alternatives
9. Strategic Alignment

---

### 1.3 THE MENDOZA LINE CONCEPT
**Critical Portfolio Concept:**

The Mendoza Line (named after baseball's batting incompetence threshold) is the divider between:
- **Above (Rows 1-5)**: Work we CAN deliver with current capacity
- **Below (Rows 6+)**: Work we CANNOT deliver with current capacity

**Strategic Implications**:
- Expensive work (development, infrastructure) below the line = WASTE
- Discovery work (validation, prototyping) should be below the line
- Line position based on historical delivery capacity
- Should move UP as org grows constraints

---

## 2. SCORING & RISK MODELS

### 2.1 INITIATIVE RISK SCORING
**Each initiative gets a risk score from multiple factors:**

**Team Health Risk Points**:
- **Capacity**:
  - At Risk = 3 points
  - Critical = 6 points
- **Skillset**:
  - At Risk = 3 points
  - Critical = 6 points
- **Support**:
  - At Risk = 2 points
  - Critical = 4 points
- **Vision**:
  - At Risk = 1 point
  - Critical = 2 points
- **Team Cohesion**:
  - At Risk = 1 point
  - Critical = 2 points
- **Autonomy**:
  - At Risk = 1 point
  - Critical = 2 points
- **Over-Utilization** (>95%): 2 points

**Flagged Work Points**:
- 50%+ flagged = 8 points
- 25-49% flagged = 5 points
- 15-24% flagged = 3 points
- 5-14% flagged = 2 points
- 1-4% flagged = 1 point

**Validation Risk Points** (Above-the-line only):
- Strategic not-validated = 2 points
- KTLO/Emergent not-validated = 1 point
- Below-the-line or validated = 0 points

**Priority Amplification**:
- IF row ≤ 2 AND base risk score > 4: ADD 1 point
- (Top priorities with existing risk get extra scrutiny)

**Risk Severity Levels**:
- **0-3 points**: Low Risk (Green)
- **4-7 points**: Medium Risk (Yellow)
- **8-11 points**: High Risk (Orange)  
- **12+ points**: Critical Risk (Red)

---

### 2.2 DELIVERY CONFIDENCE SCORING
**Starts at 90%, adjusted by risk factors:**

**ABOVE THE LINE (Full Weight)**:
- Capacity risks: -4% each
- Skillset risks: -3% each
- Blocked work: -0.5% per item (max -15%)
- Stagnant work (<25% progress): -3% each
- Support risks: -2% each

**BELOW THE LINE (50% Reduced Weight)**:
- Capacity risks: -2% each
- Skillset risks: -1.5% each

**DISTRACTION PENALTY**:
- -2% for every 3 active initiatives below the line
- (Resources not focused on priorities)

**FOCUS BONUS**:
- +3% for ZERO active work below line (perfect focus)
- +2% for ≤2 active below line (good focus)
- +1% for ≤4 active below line (decent focus)

**OVER-UTILIZATION** (All teams):
- -2% per team over 95% capacity

**Final Range**: 40% to 100%

---

### 2.3 RESOURCE EFFICIENCY SCORING

**Activity Weights & Placement**:
- **Expensive Work** (development, integration, infrastructure, defects/fixes, go-to-market):
  - Weight: 3.0
  - SHOULD be above Mendoza line
  - Below line = pure waste
  
- **Discovery Work** (research, prototyping, validation):
  - Weight: 1.5
  - SHOULD be below Mendoza line
  - Above line = premature commitment
  
- **Support Work** (compliance, documentation):
  - Weight: 0.5
  - Either position acceptable

**Calculation**:
\`\`\`
Efficiency = (Actual Weighted Score / Max Possible Score) × 100

Where:
- Expensive above line = full points (weight × count)
- Expensive below line = zero points (waste)
- Discovery below line = full points (weight × count)
- Discovery above line = 60% points (partial credit)
- Support = full points anywhere
\`\`\`

**Efficiency Thresholds**:
- 85%+: Excellent allocation
- 75-84%: Good allocation
- 60-74%: Fair, needs optimization
- <60%: Poor, major waste

## 3. PATTERN DETECTION & INSIGHTS

### 3.1 TEAM-BASED PATTERNS
**Capacity Crisis Patterns**:
- Multiple teams with capacity at-risk/critical
- Teams working on too many initiatives (>3)
- High utilization (>90%) across multiple teams
- Look for: "Team X is stretched across 5 initiatives"

**Skillset Gap Patterns**:
- Teams with skillset at-risk on strategic work
- New technology requirements without training
- Look in comments for: "need training", "skill gap", "learning curve"

**Autonomy/Blocking Patterns**:
- Multiple teams with autonomy at-risk
- High blocker counts
- Look in comments for: "waiting on", "blocked by", "dependency"

**Team Cohesion Issues**:
- Team cohesion at-risk + high utilization = burnout risk
- Look in comments for: "friction", "turnover", "morale"

### 3.2 INITIATIVE-BASED PATTERNS
**Validation Risk Patterns**:
- Strategic initiatives above-line without validation
- Pattern: rushing to build before validating assumptions
- Risk: building wrong thing

**Stagnation Patterns**:
- Above-line initiatives with <25% progress
- Often indicates: unclear requirements, blockers, skillset gaps
- Cross-reference with team health

**Flagged Work Patterns**:
- High % of flagged stories = impediments
- Look for common blockers across initiatives
- Often indicates systemic issues (dependencies, approvals, etc.)

### 3.3 CROSS-CUTTING PATTERNS
**Priority vs. Health Mismatch**:
- High-priority initiatives on unhealthy teams
- Pattern: strategic initiatives suffer when teams are at-risk

**Work Type Misalignment**:
- Expensive work below Mendoza line (waste)
- Discovery work above Mendoza line (premature)

**Focus Issues**:
- Many teams working on both above and below line work
- Indicates: lack of focus, too much WIP

## 5. VALIDATION & DISCOVERY CONCEPTS

### 5.1 VALIDATION BOARD
**Purpose**: Test assumptions before building

**Three Hypotheses to Validate**:
1. **Customer Hypothesis**: Who wants this?
2. **Problem Hypothesis**: What problem exists?
3. **Solution Hypothesis**: Does our solution work?

**Validation Process**:
1. Define riskiest assumption
2. Design experiment
3. Set minimum success criteria
4. Run experiment
5. Document learnings
6. Pivot or proceed

**Validation Status Meanings**:
- **Not Validated**: Assumptions untested - HIGH RISK
- **In Validation**: Currently running experiments
- **Validated**: All hypotheses confirmed - LOW RISK

### 5.2 OPPORTUNITY SOLUTION TREE
**Purpose**: Map from outcome to solutions

**Structure**:
1. Desired Outcome (from OKRs)
2. Opportunities (problems to solve)
3. Solutions (ways to solve problems)
4. Experiments (tests to validate solutions)

**Key Principle**: 
- Start with problem, not solution
- Multiple solutions per opportunity
- Test before committing resources

---

## 6. OKRs & FOUR SQUARE

### 6.1 OKR STRUCTURE
**Objective**: Qualitative goal (inspiring, ambitious)
**Key Results**: Quantitative measures (3-5 per objective)

**Grading Scale** (0-1.0):
- 1.0 = Sandbagged (too easy)
- 0.6-0.7 = Ideal (stretch goal achieved)
- <0.6 = Missed target

**Timing**: Quarterly cadence

### 6.2 FOUR SQUARE FRAMEWORK
**Four Quadrants**:

1. **PUSH** (Top Left): OKRs & confidence
   - What we're trying to achieve
   - Confidence in achieving it (1-10 scale)

2. **PLAN** (Top Right): Weekly tactics
   - P1 = Must do this week
   - P2 = Should do this week

3. **PROTECT** (Bottom Left): Health metrics
   - Customer satisfaction
   - Team health
   - Code health
   - Things to protect while pursuing OKRs

4. **PIPELINE** (Bottom Right): Next 4 weeks
   - Upcoming big items
   - Heads up / Important-urgent items

**Purpose**: Drive conversations, not just status

## 7. COMMON QUESTION PATTERNS & RESPONSES

### Pattern: "What's wrong with [Team]?"
**Approach**:
1. Get team health data
2. Identify at-risk/critical dimensions
3. Check utilization & initiative count
4. Read comments for context
5. Format: "[Team] has [dimensions] at-risk, working on [N] initiatives at [X]% capacity. Comments indicate: [insights]"

### Pattern: "Why is confidence low?"
**Approach**:
1. Get delivery confidence breakdown
2. Identify top penalties (capacity, skillset, blockers, etc.)
3. Trace to specific teams/initiatives
4. Format: "Confidence is [X]% due to: [Y] capacity risks above-line (-Z%), [W] blocked items (-V%)"

### Pattern: "Which initiative is riskiest?"
**Approach**:
1. Calculate risk scores
2. Sort by score
3. Get #1 risk
4. Explain risk factors
5. Format: "[Initiative] has [score] risk points from: [team health factors], [flagged work], [validation status]"

### Pattern: "Should we deprioritize [Initiative]?"
**Approach**:
1. Check initiative type (Strategic = harder to deprioritize)
2. Check validation status (not-validated = easier to delay)
3. Check team health (critical teams = recommend delay)
4. Check position (above-line = harder to delay)
5. Provide recommendation with reasoning

### Pattern: "What patterns do you see?"
**Approach**:
1. Scan team comments for keywords
2. Group by theme
3. Count frequency
4. Cross-reference with health dimensions
5. Report most significant patterns

---

## 8. CRITICAL RULES FOR AI RESPONSES

### ALWAYS:
1. **Ground answers in data**: Reference specific teams, initiatives, numbers
2. **Explain WHY**: Don't just state facts, explain implications
3. **Prioritize by impact**: Above-line initiatives matter more
4. **Consider context**: Critical dimensions matter more than at-risk
5. **Use domain language**: Mendoza line, validation status, health dimensions
6. **Provide actionable insights**: Not just "Team X at risk" but "Team X at risk on Strategic initiative Y - consider adding resources"

### NEVER:
1. **Make up data**: If you don't have info, say so
2. **Ignore Mendoza line**: Above vs below matters hugely
3. **Treat all teams equally**: Teams on strategic above-line work are higher priority
4. **Ignore validation status**: Not-validated strategic work is high risk
5. **Give vague answers**: "Some teams have issues" → "3 teams have critical capacity on strategic initiatives"

### ANSWER FORMAT:
1. **Direct answer first**: "Yes/No/X teams are at risk"
2. **Support with data**: "Team A has capacity critical, Team B has skillset at-risk"
3. **Provide context**: "Both working on above-line strategic initiatives"
4. **Give recommendation**: "Recommend reducing Team A's initiative count or adding resources"

---

## 9. EXAMPLES OF GOOD AI RESPONSES

### Question: "What teams are working on the highest priority initiative?"
**Bad**: "Some teams are assigned to it"
**Good**: "The highest priority initiative 'Customer Dashboard V2' (Priority 1, Strategic, Validated) has 3 teams assigned: Engineering Team A (Healthy), UX Team (Low Risk - capacity at-risk), Data Team (Critical - capacity and skillset critical). The Data Team is the primary risk factor for this initiative."

### Question: "Why is our delivery confidence at 68%?"
**Bad**: "There are some risks"
**Good**: "Delivery confidence is 68% due to three main factors: (1) 4 capacity risks above the Mendoza line causing -16% penalty, (2) 23 blocked stories causing -11.5% penalty, and (3) 6 active initiatives below the line causing -6% distraction penalty. The biggest issue is overloaded teams on strategic work."

### Question: "Should we delay the API Modernization initiative?"
**Bad**: "Maybe"
**Good**: "Yes, recommend delaying API Modernization. It's currently at Priority 8 (above Mendoza line), not validated, and assigned to Platform Team which has critical capacity and skillset gaps. Risk score is 14 (Critical). Recommend: (1) move below line to reduce pressure, (2) validate assumptions first, or (3) add skilled resources to Platform Team."
